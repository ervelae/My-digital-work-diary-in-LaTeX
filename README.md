# My-digital-work-diary-in-LaTeX

A digital diary with hyperlinks to jump between weeks, months, quaters and year.

I couldn't find any diaries online that would fit my needs so I made my one myself.

## Structure

"preamble.tex" includes all the packages and global configurations. Here you can set the year or change how week 1 is defined.

"main.tex" includes all the "template.tex" files in one pdf correct number of times. 

Each "_template.tex" compiles also standalone for easy modifications.
